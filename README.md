# Web Apps @ 60fps
This talk will teach you the basics of writing fast JavaScript web apps.

## Running the presentation
Part of the presentation is seeing how blocking requests affect performance, and this is difficult to do
when files are served lightning-fast off the filesystem. To "fix" this, I wrote a slow webserver
for demonstration purposes/because I'm evil. The binary is included, so on most \*nix systems you can just run:

`./server`

And visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the presentation and demos.

The presentation was recorded and is [available on Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/a/opower.com/file/d/0B86g_Cj7sISlRUhSdUtZblhUVE0/view?usp=sharing).
